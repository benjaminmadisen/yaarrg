        Yet Another Assigner of Randomized Receivers of Gifts (YAARRG) handles Secret Santa assignments without anyone knowing the assignments of anyone else.

    <ul>
        <li>
            Add participants
        </li>
        <li>
            Add exclusions (people who should't be assigned to someone - maybe they're already married, or they're in-laws, or they're mortal enemies!)
        </li>
        <li>
            Click "Assign" to generate an assignment for each person
        </li>
        <li>
            Send each person their link
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Each person's link will show them who they've been assigned to, but no one else will be able to see that information. And that's all there is to it!
